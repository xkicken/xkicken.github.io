        <h2>Eromanga Sensei</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes there is something that looks like one thing and ends up being another. Eromanga Sensei is one of those titles. On the surface it looks like your typical bother obsessed with sister stories, and that is true, but at the same time things are slightly deeper than they look on the surface.

          Eromanga-Sensei revolves around Izumi Masamune, a light novel author in high school, who lives alone with his little sister Sagiri, a shut-in girl who hasn’t left her room for an entire year. Her shut in habits are so bad, she even forces her brother to make and bring her meals when she stomps the floor. Masamune wants his sister to leave her room and interact, because the two of them are each other’s only family. Masamune’s novel illustrator, pen name “Ero Manga Sensei,” draws extremely ecchi things, and is very reliable. Masamune had never met his illustrator, and figured he was just a disgusting, perverted otaku. However, the truth is revealed. His illustrator, “Ero Manga Sensei” is his own younger sister! To add to the chaos that erupts between the siblings, a beautiful, female best-selling author becomes their rival!

          Megumi is a classmate of Sagiri, and a former amateur model. She wants to become friends with Sagiri, but is also a little perverted. Megumi is a cheerful and social girl with enough charisma to befriend many people. She seems to value friendship and tries to be helpful. She is flirtatious and has a bit of a perverted sense of humor and is confident in her looks. Masamune noted her to be positive to the point that she nearly had a positive aura and considered her a ‘Holy Attribute’. She is also perceptive, able to figure out Masamune’s feelings for Sagiri. She is also quite deceptive, seeming more innocent than she actually is and is a bit of a pervert. Overall, she seems to be a friendly girl that just wants to get along with everyone.

          Eromanga Sensei is one of those weird anime shows where you go to judge the book by the cover, but find that there is something a little deeper to things than there seems to be. On the surface, Eromanga Sensei looks like one of those weird loli or sister-love anime shows where the older brother has an obsession with his younger sister; while this is true on the surface, beyond that it is more about a girl who while having a very weird hobby (drawing Ero or “dirty” books) and an obsession with the body’s sexual organs…. But more so a story about a shut in and the attempts of the people who slowly become her friends or friend-enemy and help her rejoin the world. When viewed from this aspect, things don’t seem so bad to deal with. Eromanga Sensei got a bit of a bad rap due to being viewed in the former mindset of loli lust than the latter about a shut in who rejoins the world.

          To be honest, the characters are the biggest drawback to Eromanga Sensei. Some of the characters, like Elf Yamada especially, are more interesting than Izumi siblings. After watching things like Bakuman, which have a much greater and more realistic take on the whole manga or light novel writing worlds, watching Eromanga Sensei is like watching some weird bizzaro world. The Izumi siblings both are well known under their specific pen names but do not have any pressure from a publisher or anything else. But then again, that’s not the focus of Eromanga Sensei. Back to the characters, I think that Sagiri as a main is just too plain and boring outside of her obsession, and her brother Masamune is just too normal. This leaves the real entertainment on the B and C level characters to carry the show. Not something you want to see in any anime.

          Overall, Eromanga Sensei is a good little gateway anime if you want to take a chance and walk on the weird side of obsessions with a hint of a deeper story. While the mains are pretty boring, the side characters are more than entertaining enough to make up for it.
